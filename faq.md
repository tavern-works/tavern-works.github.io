### Will you offer a free, ad-supported subscription?

No. I will never charge more than I need to to operate Tavern, but I would rather charge a reasonable subscription fee than to accept the performance, privacy, and aesthetic tradeoffs required to run ads.

### Will you offer a lifetime subscription?

While I understand the appeal of lifetime subscriptions, I think that for an actively-developed product, they create an incentive to continue growing the user base to keep money coming in rather than focusing on creating the best product possible for existing users, so I don't plan to offer one in the near future.

That said, if at some point I think the product is complete or I reach a point of financial stability, I might consider offering one then.

### What is your view on generative AI?

I think that while generative AI can be a useful tool in theory, the way it has been deployed so far has relied on stealing work from content creators with the intention to replace them with an inferior product that can be controlled by corporate interests. I also have concerns about the massive resource usage that goes into training and running the large commercial models.

If you want to use generative AI for running your campaigns, that decision is up to you, but I will never use generative AI in the development of Tavern.
