## Tavern VTT

It's most likely that you're here because you are interested in the [Tavern&nbsp;VTT](https://tavern.works).
I am the sole developer of the VTT, which means I get all of the credit (and all of the blame).
If you'd like to send either my way, you have a few options:

<p style="display: flex; gap: 1rem">Join the Tavern Discord by clicking here: <a href="https://discord.gg/SkjzZVKe2m"><img src="/assets/images/discord.svg" height="20"></a></p>

<p style="display: flex; gap: 1rem">Follow the project on BlueSky: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tavern.works" style="display: flex; gap: 0.25rem; color: #367ff7"><img src="/assets/images/bluesky.svg" height="20"> @tavern.works</a></p>

Or, if all else fails, you can email me at <span style="user-select: all">`stoza@`</span> this website.

## Anything Else

If by some chance you're not here about Tavern, you're still welcome to email me at the address above
or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-stoza-59914224/).

## Support

If you like what I'm doing and want me to keep being able to work on Tavern full-time (and can afford it), please consider supporting me on Ko-Fi:
