# Tavern

Welcome! This is where you can find helpful information about the Tavern virtual tabletop (VTT). This information is currently broken down into three major categories:

## Product

The [User Guide](guide.html) explains how to use the VTT itself.

I also maintain a list of frequently asked questions (FAQ) [here](faq.html).

## Legal

This is also where you can also find various legal information about the site, such as the [Privacy Policy](legal/privacy.html) and the [Licenses](legal/licenses.html) under which game system content is provided.

## Contact

If you can't find what you're looking for at the above links (or if you just want to say hi!), you can get in touch with me in one of the following ways:
